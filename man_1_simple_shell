SIMPLE_SHELL

NAME

		Shell â€” command interpreter

SYNOPSIS

	./simple_shell


DESCRIPTION

	The shell is a command-line interface enabling the user to interact with a computer's operating system. It acts as a layer of abstraction between the user and the operating system kernel, enabling the user to execute commands, launch programs, navigate directories, manage files and processes, and automate tasks using scripts.

	The shell is a powerful tool for interacting with a command-line operating system, enabling users to execute commands, launch programs, navigate directories, manage files and processes, and automate tasks.

OVERVIEW

	The command interpreter reads lines from a file or terminal, interprets them and generally executes other commands. It is the program that runs when a user logs on to the system.

	It incorporates many features to facilitate interactive use, and has the advantage that the interpretation language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts).


INVOCATION

	For now, our function doesn't take any arguments, so you can only invoke by name : ./simple_shell.
